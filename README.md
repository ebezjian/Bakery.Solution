3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.


#### AppSettings:

After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
